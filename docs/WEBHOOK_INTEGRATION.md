## Custom Payload Templates

You can customize webhook payloads using template variables:

### Available Variables
- `{{event}}` - Event type (e.g., "ALERT_TRIGGERED")
- `{{timestamp}}` - Unix timestamp in milliseconds
- `{{data}}` - Full event data object

{
  "type": "{{event}}",
  "time": {{timestamp}},
  "alert_data": {{data}},
  "source": "AlgoTrader Pro"
}
```

## Event Types

| Event Type | Description | When Triggered |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| `ALERT_TRIGGERED` | Price or indicator alert triggered | When any configured alert condition is met |
| `ORDER_FILLED` | Order successfully filled | When a market or limit order executes |
| `POSITION_OPENED` | New trading position opened | When entering a new trade |
| `POSITION_CLOSED` | Trading position closed | When exiting a trade |
| `STOP_LOSS_HIT` | Stop loss order triggered | When stop loss price is reached |
| `TAKE_PROFIT_HIT` | Take profit order triggered | When take profit price is reached |
| `RISK_WARNING` | Risk management alert | When risk thresholds are exceeded |
| `VOLATILITY_ALERT` | High volatility detected | When volatility spikes above threshold |

---

## Retry Logic

Webhooks automatically retry on failure:

1. **Initial Attempt**: Immediate send
2. **Retry 1**: After 1 second
3. **Retry 2**: After 2 seconds
4. **Retry 3**: After 3 seconds

Configure retry attempts (0-10) per webhook.

---

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

1. **Timeout**: Request took longer than configured timeout
   - Default: 5 seconds
   - Configurable: 1-30 seconds

2. **Connection Failed**: Unable to reach webhook URL
   - Check URL is correct and accessible
   - Verify firewall/network settings

3. **HTTP Error**: Server returned error status
   - Check webhook configuration
   - Verify authentication/headers

### Viewing Logs

1. Go to **Settings > Webhooks**
2. Click **View Logs**
3. Review recent webhook attempts
4. Check status, error messages, and retry counts

---

## Security Considerations

1. **HTTPS Only**: All webhook URLs must use HTTPS
2. **Secure Storage**: Webhook URLs stored in browser localStorage
3. **No Sensitive Data**: Avoid including API keys in webhook configs
4. **Custom Headers**: Use for authentication when needed
5. **Testing**: Always test webhooks before relying on them

---

## Integration with Alert Service

Webhooks are automatically triggered when:
- An alert's conditions are met (via AlertService)
- Orders are filled (future: OrderService integration)
- Positions are opened/closed (future: PositionService integration)
- Risk warnings occur (future: RiskManagementService integration)

The webhook service listens for these events and sends notifications to all enabled webhooks that have subscribed to the specific event type.

---

## API Reference

### WebhookService Methods

#### `addWebhook(webhook: Partial<WebhookConfig>): WebhookConfig`
Create a new webhook configuration.

#### `updateWebhook(id: string, updates: Partial<WebhookConfig>): void`
Update an existing webhook.

#### `deleteWebhook(id: string): void`
Delete a webhook configuration.

#### `triggerWebhook(event: WebhookEvent, data: any): Promise<void>`
Manually trigger a webhook event (usually called by services).

#### `testWebhook(webhookId: string): Promise<boolean>`
Send a test payload to verify webhook configuration.

## Troubleshooting
